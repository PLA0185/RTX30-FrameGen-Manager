///
/// · Every request is HTTPS, on an allow-listed host whose resolved addresses must all be public.
///   Redirects are followed manually with the same checks at each hop.
/// · Response size is capped, and archive entries may not escape the destination folder.
/// · The payload is verified after download: every proxy DLL must carry a valid Authenticode
///   signature. For third-party mirrors the signer must also match a pinned certificate
///   thumbprint, because the mirror is not the authority for the content. For GitHub's own
///   endpoints the certificate is logged but not required to match, so a future certificate
///   rotation upstream does not break downloads.
///
/// Sources are tried in order of authority and efficiency, so a blocked or flaky endpoint only
/// costs a fallback rather than a failed download.
